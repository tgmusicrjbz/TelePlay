## 🛠 Step 1: Get Telegram Credentials

You need three things from Telegram to make this work:

### 1.1 API ID and API Hash

1. Log in to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) using your phone number.
2. Click on **"API development tools"**.
3. Create a new "App" (you can name it "TelePlay").
4. Once created, you will see `App api_id` and `App api_hash`. **Copy these and keep them safe.**

### 1.2 Bot Token

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**.
2. Send the command `/newbot`.
3. Follow the instructions to name your bot.
4. @BotFather will give you an **API Token**. It looks like `123456:ABC-DEF1234...`. **Copy this.**

### 1.3 Helper Bots (Optional - For faster speeds)

To increase download speeds, you can create multiple bots (e.g., "TelePlay Helper 1", "TelePlay Helper 2").

1. Get the tokens for each from @BotFather.
2. **Crucial**: Add every helper bot as an **Administrator** to your Storage Channel.

### 1.4 Storage Channel ID

1. Create a **Private Channel** in Telegram.
2. Add your new bot as an **Administrator** in that channel with permission to post messages.
3. To find the Channel ID:
   - Forward a message from the channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
   - It will reply with the "Id". It usually starts with `-100...` (e.g., `-100123456789`).
   - Alternatively, use the web version of Telegram; the ID is in the URL after `/#-`.

## 💻 Step 2: Choose Your Platform

### A. Local Machine

_Best if you just want to see it working on your own computer._

Create a private Telegram storage channel, add your bot as an administrator with permission to post and delete messages, and collect the API ID, API hash, bot token, and channel ID from Step 1.

**Windows PowerShell, running the source directly:**

1. In the project root, run `Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env` and `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force backend/data`.
2. Edit `backend/.env` with your credentials. Set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/teleplay.db`, `WEB_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`, and a long random `JWT_SECRET`. Leave `TELEGRAM_HELPER_BOT_TOKENS` and `AUTH_USERS` empty unless needed.
3. In one terminal, run `cd backend`, `python -m venv .venv` if necessary, `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
4. In a second terminal, run `cd web`, `npm install` if necessary, then `npm run dev`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on the same computer. The backend health endpoint is [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health). Use the login code shown by the web app and send `/login CODE` to your bot.

**Docker Desktop:** Use the root `.env.example` as the template for a **root** `.env` file (not `backend/.env`), set `WEB_BASE_URL=http://localhost`, start Docker Desktop, then run `docker compose up -d --build` from the project root. Open [http://localhost](http://localhost). Stop any directly running backend first so only one process receives bot updates.

With a local HTTP address, the bot's web button shows code-login instructions because Telegram rejects localhost button URLs. For a Telegram Mini App, expose the web frontend at an HTTPS address and set `WEB_BASE_URL` to that address.

### B. Railway

_Best for "one-click" cloud deployment. Very fast to set up._

1. Create a [Railway.app](https://railway.app/) account.
2. Click **"New Project"** -> **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**.
3. Select your repository.
4. **Settings Configuration**:
   - Go to **Settings** tab.
   - Under **Build**, set "Dockerfile Path" to `Dockerfile` (in the root).
5. **Add Variables**:
   - Go to the **Variables** tab.
   - Click "New Variable" and add:
     - `TELEGRAM_API_ID`
     - `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`
     - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
     - `TELEGRAM_STORAGE_CHANNEL_ID`
     - `JWT_SECRET` (A random long string of letters)
6. **Done!** Academy will build and give you a URL.

---

### C. Render

_Another great cloud option with persistent storage._

1. Create a [Render.com](https://render.com/) account.
2. Click **"New"** -> **"Web Service"**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository.
4. **Runtime**: Select **Docker**.
5. **Advanced Settings**:
   - Dockerfile Path: `./Dockerfile`
   - Build Context: `.`
6. **Environment Variables**: Add all the variables mentioned in the Railway section above.
7. **Disks (Crucial)**:
   - Scroll to the bottom and click **"Add Disk"**.
   - Name: `session-data`
   - Mount Path: `/app/session`
   - Size: `1GB` (This keeps you logged in even if the server restarts).

---

### D. CapRover

_Best if you already have a VPS with CapRover installed. It provides a "One-Click" like experience for your own server._

1. **Dashboard Setup**:
   - Log in to your CapRover dashboard.
   - Click **"Apps"** and create a new app (e.g., `teleplay`).
   - Click on the app name to open its settings.

2. **Persistent Storage (Crucial)**:
   - Go to **"App Configs"**.
   - Under **"Persistent Directories"**, click **"Add persistent directory"**.
   - Path in App: `/app/session`
   - Label: `teleplay-session`
   - This ensures your session data is not lost when the app restarts.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Stay in **"App Configs"**.
   - You need to add all the variables listed in the [Environment Variables Guide](#environment-variables-glossary) below.
   - Click **"Add Environment Variable"** for each one.

4. **Network Settings**:
   - Set the **Container Port** to `8000`.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Go to **"Deployment"** tab.
   - **Method 1 (Git)**: Connect your GitHub repo. CapRover will find the `captain-definition` file and start building immediately.
   - **Method 2 (CLI)**: Run `caprover deploy` from your local folder.

6. **HTTPS**:
   - Go to **"HTTP Settings"**.
   - Click **"Enable HTTPS"**.
   - Check **"Force HTTPS"**.

---

### E. VPS / Docker Compose

_For users who want full control over their own server._

1. SSH into your VPS.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo_url> teleplay && cd teleplay`
3. Setup environment:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Enter your keys
   cd ..
   ```
4. Start everything: `docker compose up -d --build`
5. Access via `http://your-vps-ip`.

---

## 🏁 Step 3: Post-Deployment Setup

1. **Login**:
   - Visit your website URL.
   - Click "Login with Telegram".
   - You might see a code on the screen. Send this code to your bot in Telegram!
2. **Android TV**:
   - Download the APK from the GitHub releases.
   - Install it on your TV (you may need to enable "Unknown Sources").
   - Enter your server URL (e.g., `https://myteleplay.up.railway.app`).

## 🔗 How to find your Server URL

Your **Server URL** is the address where your app is running. You need this to log in to the Web App and to connect your Android TV.

| Platform          | How to find your URL                                          | Example                              |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| **Local Machine** | Open terminal and type `ipconfig`. Look for **IPv4 Address**. | `http://192.168.1.100`               |
| **VPS / Docker**  | Use the **Public IP** of your VPS provider's dashboard.       | `http://159.65.123.45`               |
| **Railway**       | Go to **Settings** -> **Public Networking** -> **Domains**.   | `https://teleplay.up.railway.app`    |
| **Render**        | Go to your **Web Service Dashboard**, URL is at the top.      | `https://teleplay.onrender.com`      |
| **CapRover**      | Go to **Apps** -> **[Your App]** -> **URL**.                  | `https://teleplay.apps.mydomain.com` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - If you are using **Android TV** on the same Wi-Fi as your PC, use the **Local Machine IP** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.xxx`).

## 🗄 Database Setup Guide

TelePlay supports two types of databases: **PostgreSQL** (Professional/Stable) and **SQLite** (Simple/Local).

### 1. SQLite

SQLite is a simple file-based database. No extra server needed.

- **URL Format**: `sqlite:///./data/teleplay.db`
- **Best for**: Running on your own computer (Local Machine) or a small VPS with few users.
- **Note**: Not recommended for Railway/Render without persistent storage for the file.

### 2. PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, separate database server. It is the best choice for a stable web app.

- **URL Format**: `postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database_name`

#### How to set up PostgreSQL:

- **Cloud (Railway/Render)**: Both platforms let you add a "PostgreSQL" service to your project with one click. They will automatically give you the `DATABASE_URL`.
- **CapRover**:
  - Go to **"Apps"** -> **"One-Click Apps"**.
  - Search for **"Postgres"**.
  - Install it and note the password/hostname.
- **External (Supabase - Recommended)**:
  - If you don't want to host your own database, go to [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).
  - Create a new project (it's free).
  - Go to **Settings** -> **Database**.
  - Copy the **Connection String** (use the "URI" or "Direct Connection" string) and use it as your `DATABASE_URL`.
  - **Important**: If utilizing Supabase, ensure the connection string starts with `postgresql://`.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **"Port already in use"**: Another app is using port 80. You can change the port in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **"Missing Variables"**: Double-check your `.env` file. Do not use quotes around the values unless they have spaces.
- **"Connection Timeout"**: If on a VPS, make sure ports 80 and 8000 are open in your firewall.
